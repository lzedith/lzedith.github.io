# 1. Disclaimer

**NOTE**: The re-edit of the movie is created purely for practicing purposes and personal use only. No commercial application of the material is intended or allowed. The copyright is fully recognised to be owned by the owners of the original film material. The video is only presented on this website for the purposes of demonstrating the art of editing. 

# 2. Goal

This particular edit seeks to tell the same story as in the original movie, which means in **most** of the scenes the meaning is left to be the same, but: there are changes within the majority of the scenes, some scenes are reordered, and some scenes are removed entirely.

The main goal of the recut was to try and remove as much runtime as possible, while also:

1. Preserve the main story being told
2. Maintain a working pacing
3. Try to make sense of most of the scenes
4. Get rid of as much shoe-leather as possible
