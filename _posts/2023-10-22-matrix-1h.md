# 1. Disclaimer

**NOTE**: The re-edit of the movie is created purely for practicing purposes and personal use only. No commercial application of the material is intended or allowed. The copyright is fully recognised to be owned by the owners of the original film material. The video is only presented on this website for the purposes of demonstrating the art of editing. 

# 2. Goal

This particular edit seeks to tell the same story as in the original movie, which means in **most** of the scenes the meaning is left to be the same, but: there are changes within the majority of the scenes, some scenes are reordered, and some scenes are removed entirely.

The main goal of the recut was to try and remove as much runtime as possible, while also:

1. Preserve the main story being told
2. Maintain a working pacing
3. Try to make sense of most of the scenes
4. Get rid of as much shoe-leather as possible 

# 3. Intro

**NOTE**: first I recognise that the original film is truly a cult classic, a cultural phenomenon, has spawned armies of fans all across the planet, and inspired countless new works of science- and other -fiction and art and film and so on. Whatever the writers and directors of the movie have been doing - at that time they have produced something magical, or it would have never got as much attention as it has. I am in no right to be pretending to sit here on a high cinematographic horse 24 years later  with no deadline and speculate on whether some different approach would have made the movie better or not. And I am definitely not pretending to be better or smarter or more experienced than the creators of the movie at the time. I have no idea what I'm doing anyways.

What I **CAN** do is to take the film and play the game of _“what I would do, if ever given such source material (plus no deadline, no budget limitations, no studio input, and having already seen the original movie itself)”_. Which is exactly what I'm doing and nothing more. This is important to understand that it's **NOT** an attempt at making the particular film better, or to make a better film. It's merely a fantasy to see what would happen if I have ever got to edit a movie like that.
