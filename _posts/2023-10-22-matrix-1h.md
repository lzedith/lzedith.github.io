# 1. Disclaimer

**NOTE**: The re-edit of the movie is created purely for practicing purposes and personal use only. No commercial application of the material is intended or allowed. The copyright is fully recognised to be owned by the owners of the original film material. The video is only presented on this website for the purposes of demonstrating the art of editing. 

# 2. Goal

This particular edit seeks to tell the same story as in the original movie, which means in **most** of the scenes the meaning is left to be the same, but: there are changes within the majority of the scenes, some scenes are reordered, and some scenes are removed entirely.

The main goal of the recut was to try and remove as much runtime as possible, while also:

1. Preserve the main story being told
2. Maintain a working pacing
3. Try to make sense of most of the scenes
4. Get rid of as much shoe-leather as possible 

# 3. Intro

**NOTE**: first I recognise that the original film is truly a cult classic, a cultural phenomenon, has spawned armies of fans all across the planet, and inspired countless new works of science- and other -fiction and art and film and so on. Whatever the writers and directors of the movie have been doing - at that time they have produced something magical, or it would have never got as much attention as it has. I am in no right to be pretending to sit here on a high cinematographic horse 24 years later  with no deadline and speculate on whether some different approach would have made the movie better or not. And I am definitely not pretending to be better or smarter or more experienced than the creators of the movie at the time. I have no idea what I'm doing anyways.

What I **CAN** do is to take the film and play the game of _“what I would do, if ever given such source material (plus no deadline, no budget limitations, no studio input, and having already seen the original movie itself)”_. Which is exactly what I'm doing and nothing more. This is important to understand that it's **NOT** an attempt at making the particular film better, or to make a better film. It's merely a fantasy to see what would happen if I have ever got to edit a movie like that.

# 4. Process

When watching a movie specifically for analysis I am trying to pay attention to these elements:

- The order of scenes. How scenes follow each other. How plot setups are established and how they are resolved.


- Character contributions to the plot. How different characters add value and what is the motivation for them to exist.


- The “flow” within scenes. How tightly scenes deliver plot points, how smoothly it flows off the screen, how much shoe-leather and padding is there in scenes.


- The “feel” of the dialogue. How natural dialogue delivery feels (NOT same as “realistic”) vs how forced it feels. How smooth the dialogue transitions are. What we see when someone is speaking and why.


- The overall sound of each scene. How clear and distinct different actions or dialogue lines can be heard. What feeling the sound adds, if any. Is there music and what purpose does it serve.

As I am cutting film into separate scenes, I am taking notes about each scene according to these points: how it relates to other scenes, how it feels itself, what purpose characters serve in it, how it sounds, etc.

# 5. Goals

The next step is to compile a list of things I'd like to try changing in the film and why.

### Padded run-time

The first noticeable thing over an analysing rewatch of the movie is how “padded” the runtime is. It might be only me, but it seemed like every single scene is taking as much time as possible and then some on top of it. Shots that don’t serve any apparent purpose are inserted. Long pans when a cut would work as well. Many shots that only serve for action continuity even when it doesn’t seem necessary. Character reactions feel awkwardly long sometimes because dialog edits take more time than they could.

This could be understandable in a shorter film that needs additional timing, but in a movie that is 130+ minutes long I think you need a really good reason for every single minute of that runtime to exist.

Immediately the idea came up to try and see if some of the things can be edited “tighter”: removing some of the shots, cutting out some padding to make reactions snappier, cutting out some duplicated action, removing some shots that serve for continuity only in cases when I feel the order of events might be clear without it.

### Dead-end scenes

The next big noticeable thing is how some scenes just lead to nowhere in the overall story.

- Agents put a tracking device into Neo and you think: “boy, that’s a good setup, I wonder how this will probably serve as a Chekhov Gun later and will maybe become a major plot turning point somewhere down the movie.” - And then the device gets removed in literally the next scene with no consequences whatsoever and is never mentioned in the movie again. You watch it like (o_o) and realise the only purpose for the tracking device to exist in the movie is because they didn’t know how to exit the interrogation scene in a better way.


- Neo oversleeps, gets late to work, and is facing his boss who is telling him how their company functions and how Neo must choose to get to work in time right since this moment or choose to get himself another job. Conflict is getting established. Drama is being created. This is great stuff! And then both the work and the boss are never mentioned in the movie ever again. I get the symbolism of the boss telling Neo he must choose to find himself another job and Neo sorta does exactly that, but is it worth a whole minute of a monologue about a company that we never hear about ever again? Feels like there could be a more effective way to deliver that one line within the story.


- Neo gets in the car and Switch tells him to pull up his shirt. When asked “why”, she acts like a crazy person and tells him basically to either obey her and ask no questions or get out, Neo says he is out and tries to exit the car, Trinity stops him and just says to trust them, and then Neo just says “ok then”, sits back and pulls the shirt right up. Not only this is completely mental behaviour, but also this is a pointless insert that changes nothing and gets all characters right back at the same exact point they were at before. They could have just said “there might be a tracking device on you, we need to check”.
