I am a beginner film editor. My goal it to learn how to edit video in various interesting and expressive ways. I think the best way to learn this craft is to get as much practice as possible and the most fun practice is to try your own approach at editing something you like.

The main goal of this website is just to log my progress through the practice. To be able to openly check it later and see if there is any improvement over time.

**NOTE**: all materials on the website are for educational and personal use only! No commercial application of any materials is intended or allowed.
