I am a beginner film editor. My goal is to learn how to edit video in various interesting and expressive ways. I believe the best way to learn this craft is to get as much practice as possible, and the most enjoyable practice is to try your own approach at editing something you like.

The main goal of this website is to log my progress through practice. This allows me to openly check it later and see if there is any improvement over time.
